## About The Articles

When I started learning to code, like many others, I was always so bogged down with the nuances of the syntax of the language like the names of methods and operations. After trying out GPT-3 for myself and reading this article, I'm truly fascinating by the reality that we are moving towards a world where we wouldn't have to write code ourselves and engineers would literally speak their ideas. I am also curious about how this would affect software engineers both positively and negatively.

## Badr's Comment

It was really interesting to read! I fully agree with you and I can confirm how insane GPT-3 is and how promising it is since I have used it myself. Coding in natural language would be ideal honestly and would solve all the issues that come with the syntax and differences across programming languages. I would say it would have a negative impact on software engineers.
